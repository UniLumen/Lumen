# How It Works

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This application can be tweaked to work for any university, but it's focused on [FCIS Ain Shams](https://cis.asu.edu.eg/)

Lumen uses a custom-built algorithm to analyze course times, student preferences, and university constraints to generate optimal schedules. By prioritizing minimal gaps between classes, Lumen can significantly reduce downtime for students.

## User Side

> [!NOTE]
> Users are university students who want to save their valuable time and optimize their schedules

As a user, you add the university courses that you want to attend and specify which parts of the courses you wish to attend (lectures, labs, or tutorials)

Then you enter your group and section number and you let Lumen generate for you the optimized schedule that enables you to attend all that you want in the way that saves you the most time

But where do the courses the user adds come from and how does the application optimize schedules?    
This is where the Editor's Side comes into play

## Editor Side

> [!NOTE]
> Editors are anyone who volunteered or was assigned by the university to fill in the university data inside Lumen
